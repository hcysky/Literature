- [ ] 🍁 Active versus passive reading: how to read scientific papers?


小疑则小悟，大疑则大悟，不疑则不悟。  
If you read/do research with small questions in mind, you learn small things. If you do so with big questions in mind, you learn big things. If you do so with no question in mind, you learn nothing.

Four questions:
1. What is the question that the authors are trying to address,and why is it important?
2. If this were my thesis project, what kind of experimental approach can I take in tackling the problem?
3. What kind of data would I need to generate in order to support the conclusions of this paper?
4. How would this conclusion fit into my previous understanding of this subject?

Questioning (Q), Predicting/Comparing (P/C): 
An important consequence of this ‘Predicting-and-Comparing’ approach is that it enables you to gain a deep understanding of the strategies and rationale for the study, critically evaluate the authors’ experimental design and data, and judge whether their results support their conclusions.
